Once you are here in /data , compile the program using the command, g++ main.cpp

Run the program using ./a.out

When the program is running, enter a number for the algorithm you'd like to run.

The program ends when you run an algorithm, so you must tun the program five times, to test the 5 algorithms.

Open the generated file using the command, nano SortedCenters.txt

This SortedCenter.txt is overwritten for each run thorugh of the program.
